# Thyroid Disease Recurrence Prediction Project

## Project Overview

### About Project
The Thyroid Disease Data project aims to utilize patient demographics and blood test results to predict the recurrence of well-differentiated thyroid cancer. The dataset, spanning over 15 years, includes 17 features collected from patients who were followed for at least 10 years.

### About Dataset
This dataset comprises 17 clinicopathologic features designed to predict the recurrence of thyroid cancer. The data was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Content of the Dataset
1. **Age:** Patient's age at diagnosis or treatment.
2. **Gender:** Patient's gender.
3. **Smoking:** Patient's smoking status.
4. **Hx Smoking:** Patient's smoking history.
5. **Hx Radiotherapy:** History of radiotherapy treatment.
6. **Thyroid Function:** Status of thyroid function.
7. **Physical Examination:** Findings from a physical examination.
8. **Adenopathy:** Presence of enlarged lymph nodes.
9. **Pathology:** Specific types of thyroid cancer.
10. **Focality:** Unifocal or multifocal cancer presence.
11. **Risk:** Risk category based on various factors.
12. **T:** Tumor classification.
13. **N:** Nodal classification.
14. **M:** Metastasis classification.
15. **Stage:** Overall stage of cancer.
16. **Response:** Treatment response.
17. **Recurred:** Indicates if cancer has recurred.

## Analysis and Data Interpretation

### KDE Plot Analysis of Age by Recurred Status
The KDE plot visualizes the age distribution of patients by their recurrence status.

#### Observations:
1. **Age Distribution for 'Cancer has not recurred':**
   - Prominent peak for patients up to the age of 30.
   - Significant drop in density beyond age 30.

2. **Age Distribution for 'Cancer has recurred':**
   - Smaller, dispersed peak across different ages.
   - No significant increase in density at any particular age.

#### Analysis:
- Younger patients (under 30) have a higher likelihood of non-recurrence.
- Cancer recurrence is more evenly distributed across different ages.

#### Conclusion:
The KDE plot indicates a higher probability of non-recurrence in younger patients, with recurrence status being less age-dependent. This insight helps tailor follow-up and treatment plans based on age.

#### Recommendations:
1. **Focused Monitoring:** Enhance follow-up care for younger patients.
2. **Further Research:** Investigate other factors influencing cancer recurrence.
3. **Age-Specific Interventions:** Develop programs to support older patients at higher risk.

### Spearman's Rank Correlation Matrix Interpretation
The Spearman's rank correlation coefficients between different variables in the dataset provide insights into their relationships.

#### Key Findings:
1. **Age:** Moderate positive correlation with Stage (0.49) and Recurred (0.21).
2. **Gender, Smoking, Hx Smoking, Hx Radiotherapy, etc.:** Various weak to moderate correlations indicating complex interactions.

#### Analysis:
- **Age:** Older age may correlate with higher cancer stage and recurrence.
- **Stage and Recurred:** Strong associations with risk assessment and disease stage.
- **Treatment Features:** Weak correlations suggest complex relationships not fully captured by rank-based measures.

#### Conclusion:
The correlation matrix highlights important associations, particularly the strong correlation between risk assessment, stage, and recurrence, guiding further analysis and intervention strategies.
